<h1>Project 1</h1>
<hr />

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In a world where the news is terrible, people are questionable, and the world seems to be in utter disarray, we'd like to shift perspective on humanity on focus on the greatness we can achieve.</p>
<h3>User Stories:</h3>
<p>A user can share a moment or experience that happened to them for the purpose of inspiring, motivating, or offer perspective.</p>
<p>Data is rendered in a moments feed, displayed on a map, or both.</p>
<h5>Sharing a moment</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Make a form that takes user text input and validates required content is there</li>
  <li>have several categories selectable based on relevance of moment</li>
  <li>optional location tag</li>
</ul>
<h5>Consuming a moment</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Users can read a random experience from someone else based on our stored data</li>
</ul>
